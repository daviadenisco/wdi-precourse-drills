UNIT 2, EXERCISE 1

README.md link was not provided, so I'm using this dummy README.md to show that I understand how to use relative links and how to make the links open in a new tab.

DIRECTIONS GIVEN:
You will not create a separate page of HTML for each movie title on the result's page. We want, however, you to gain practice with hyperlinks. Please write the code to make each movie title a hyperlink. When the link is clicked, a new tab should open. Using a relative  link, have the tab open to this README.md.

README.md template from GitHub:

Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
